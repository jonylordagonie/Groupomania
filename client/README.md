<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Groupomania project is the latest project of the Openclassrooms Web Developer training.
In this one we must create a social network for the company Groupomania so that the employers can exchange freely.
For this project we are free to choose the frontend framework of our choice. Backend side we had to use Mysql.
Finally, the company's communication officer must have control over the interactions of the employees.
This project must bring together two features, that of having a discussion forum as well as that of being able to share images or gifs.
Before launching the final version, we must present an intermediate step where only one of the two features is implemented.
It is this intermediate stage that I present to you here.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Now is the time to make this project work. The following instructions are for installing and running the project locally. No instructions will be given here to put it online.<br>
I show you a way to install it locally but there is another way to do it. You can choose the method you want.

### Preresquisites

To run the frontend part of the project you will need a code editor.<br>
I put you the links of what I would use for this installation:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) : I recommend this free editor which has an integrated terminal.
